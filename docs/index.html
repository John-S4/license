    <h1>Climate Strike Software</h1>
    <p>Climate Strike Software is software that uses the <a href="">Climate Strike License</a>, a software license that developers can use to prohibit the use of their code by applications or companies that threaten to accelerate climate change through fossil fuel extraction. This includes all software applications that can profit from the intent to make fossil fuel extraction more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>While the Climate Strike License violates the Open Source Initiative's canonical Open Source Definition, which explicitly excludes licenses that limit re-use "in a specific field of endeavor", we feel that as tech workers, we should take responsibility in how our software is used, and that the urgency of climate change cannot be limited by the ideological position of open source software. Instead, we want adopters of the Climate Strike License to take a bold stance in the fight to save the planet.</p>
    <p>Despite the urgency of climate change, oil production is at an all-time high. The use of new technology is one of the main reasons behind the growth. Reservoirs that were deemed too costly to harvest are now being harvested with better equipment, processes, and software. Most recently, oil and gas companies have begun to use cloud computing, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence to further accelerate fossil fuel extraction. In their profit-maximizing short-sightedness, oil and gas companies will continue to use software to automate and optimize oil production.</p>
    <p>By adopting the Climate Strike License, developers can explicitly prohibit the use of their software within some of the largest oil companies including Chevron, BP, Exxon Mobil, and many more that turn a blind eye to the greatest threat that humanity has faced.</p>
    <p>This license reminds developers that we have the power to stop these multinational oil companies from taking advantage of open source software -- that instead of waiting idly by, that they can take an active position in preventing a climate catastrophe.</p>
